# ethNotary

Project for Bachelor's Degree Final Project in Computer Engineering.

## About the project

ethNotary serves as a web application to upload documents into a public test Ethereum blockchain using IPFS. 
Users need to download Metamask in order to connect to the app and start interacting with the blockchain.
Currently is only on test phase and I don't have a plan to get it to production.


## Running it

Go to the project directory and run the following commands (NodeJS and NPM need to be installed):
### `npm install`
### `yarn start`
